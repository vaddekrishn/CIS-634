CIS 634 Object Oriented Software Engineering

Project Name:- Student Internship Management System
Abstract:-
The goal of the project is to create an easy-to-use android application software that may be used 
to handle applications from students who submit their internship applications online using an 
android application, with faculty members evaluating and administrators approving the 
applications. The project's scope includes, but is not limited to, creating deliverables and 
documentation based on requirements such as class diagrams, component diagrams, user 
requirements, as well as system development.
Introduction:-
The student Internship management system is an Android app that is an online internship 
management android application in which a student can be able to apply for an internship by 
submitting his application form online through the application to the concerned faculty on the 
other end faculty could be able to go through the application form that is submitted by the 
student and review the details of the employer during which the student can be able to find the 
internship. The admin can examine both the overall number of students and the number of 
students who applied for internships in the meanwhile.
The development of the software application will result in the paperless, real-time streamlining 
of the application process, which might help the company save time. Many students will find it 
helpful to apply for an internship using this straightforward software since it will be the only 
place, they can seek rather than going via several job portals and applications and monitoring 
them, which will be quite challenging. Many students also are unaware of the application 
procedure for internships, which causes them to lose out on possibilities. Our application will 
serve as a central location for students from various universities to apply for internship 
opportunities in any department of any organization.
