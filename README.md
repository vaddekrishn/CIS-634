                                                                   CIS 634 Software Engineering
                                                                              Project

The goal of the project is to create an easy-to-use android application software that may be used to handle applications from students who submit their internship applications online using an android application, with faculty members evaluating and administrators approving the applications. The project's scope includes, but is not limited to, creating deliverables and documentation based on requirements such as class diagrams, component diagrams, user requirements, as well as system development.

The Structure have three folders 
                            1. Documentation.
                            2. Project Code.
